Shiori~n! Shiori Novella here, at your service.
*stab*
Aaaaa!!!
Now, how do I eat this?
I wouldn’t recommend eating it. Eating human flesh can lead to a variety of health issues, including but not limited to, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, with a mortality rate of 100%.
As if that is going to stop me.
I don’t feel too well…
Oh nyo, I think he kaputted.
*pause*
You’re dead after I cut off only a little piece of your arm? Wow, you suck.

Before that, can you go check up on Biboo? She’s in the basement/streaming room.
Wait, Biboo’s here too?
Yeah, I’m getting a little worried about her; I knocked her out pretty hard.
Eh? Wh-Why did you have to knock her out?
Because she was trying to call the police.
Oh, that… that makes sense. Sure, I’ll go see if she’s fine.
Thanks, and I’m going to go get some tools for the body.
O-Okay.
*Shiori leaves*
Oh my God, Shiori. I mean, I love you, but still…


Good thing I have this big dumpy of mine. About the only time it comes in handy, though.
*yawn* (Nerissa said, as she yawned profusely.)
Sleepy as always, except during the night when the insomnia kicks in.
Eh huh…
Anyway, I have to get this/these back to Shiori; let’s get going!

Good God.

Oh, fudge!

A collection of porcelain dolls.
I used to have way more of these; 32 to be exact.

Salt is jumping at your thighs.

Hi, Pepper!
*shits on the floor*
Pepper?! I can’t believe you would just shit on the floor right in front of me. Again.

Girl dinner it is, then.

I’m not a cheater, I’m Nerissa!

Hiya darlings, my name is-
…
Eh?
*pause*
What is going on?
*pause*
He’s dead! What have you done?
It’s fine; we can still talk to AI Dimitri.
W-What? No that’s… that’s not what I meant.
Anyway, I need you to help me hide this body. Someone might come looking for him and I don’t want to be caught with it in my house.
Umm… ok. But how do we do it?
I don’t know. Let’s ask AI Dimitri!
How to hide a body, Dimitri? I can’t get caught; I have to protect our happy sugar life!
Don’t. Call the authorities and turn yourself in.
Shiori taps on the keyboard.
Better ask Emomitri.
You could cut up the body into small pieces, mix it with potting soil, and plant something in it. The body will be nowhere to be found and will quickly end up absorbed into the soil, and later the plant.
Now we’re talking! Okay, now, what is the best way to eat it?
Eating human flesh is dangerous, especially if raw or undercooked. Your cooking is literally poison, Shiori.
Never mind.

I’m shorry, but I have to do thish.

Damn, I wish someone tied me up like that.
Nerissa? What are you doing here?
Shiori called me to help with the… umm…
… the body?
… yeah …
Okay, whatever. Quick, untie me, please. We need to call the police!
The police?! I-I’m afraid I can’t do that, Biboo.
What? Why not?
If we call the police, Shiori is going to get arrested, and I don’t want to let that happen.
If she turns herself in, she will get a reduced sentence! This is the best option. Do you really want to help her hide that body? You will be complicit in that crime!
I… guess so, yeah.
…
…
Okay, it’s your choice. By the way, can you at least get me something to eat? I haven’t eaten anything all day. I’m starving.
Yeah, sure. I’ll go get you something.
Thanks.
But before I go, can I ask you a very important question?
Yeah, sure. What is it?
Can I touch your boobies?
… right now? In this situation?!
Yeah! Anytime is a good time to touch some boobies!
Just go already.
Okay...
My mothers will hear about this.
-pause-
Okay, she’s gone. Now is the best time to look around this place and find something that could help me get out of this situation.
*turn to rock, slip out of chair, turn back*
Let’s go, there’s no time to waste!

What’s this? A pebble? What is it doing here?
-pause-
In any case, this could be it. If I manage to find three others, I’ll be able to perform the secret ritual, which will surely be enough to overpower everyone!
I should probably check other rooms too; there might be more elsewhere in the house.
Fortunately, the door doesn’t seem to be locked, but I still have to be careful. I can’t get caught snooping around.

Okay, this is the last one. Now, let’s go back to the streaming room.
*teleport*
The only thing left, needed for the ritual, is the blood of the innocent.
Thankfully, there seems to be a fresh body waiting in the kitchen. Let’s go!

I'm not a chihuahua, I'm Fuwawa!
I'm not Fuwawa, I'm-
Aaaaaaa!!!
Wh-What is going on?
I don’t know…
He’s so cold.
What should we do?
Call an ambulance, Moco-chan! And I will look for some blankets to warm him up!
Okay, got it!

Wait, let me save some for later.

I guess it’s Shiover now!

It’s Shiover.

Neeeeigh.

The slab archive.
An idol meeting chair.
At least I don’t have to hover over this one.

A couple of rubber ducks.
Hi there, my rubber duckies!

A book titled “How Not to Tangent.” with a handwritten note attached, saying: ” Never mind, they love it.”
Well, that was a waste of money.

I guess he really is now “The Meat Tree”.

I guess he won’t get to have his happy sugar life now.

I can’t get caught; I have to protect our happy sugar life.

That would be sadshi.
I would be sadshi if that happened.

Willy Wonka.
Willy Wonka’d.
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

Shiori, you sick fuck. (Shiori to herself)

My OCD is kicking in. It’s never going to be perfect. My parents are never going to love me.
It’s a joke. It’s a joke.


…
He’s getting a little stiff. I guess he had a visit from a certain Mortis.
Who?
Rigor mortis.
Eh?
*Shiori looking at the body*
Is something wrong?
I wonder how this looks under a microscope.
…
Maybe I should take a sample.
*takes sample*

I guess this is now a murder house.
Not too far off my childhood home.
Eh?
It’s a joke. It’s a joke. I love my parents, I swear.
Oh, Shiori~n.

*shiori calling*
It’s Shiori! Good thing I just finished my soup bath. Tee hee.
Hey, Shiori! What’s up?
Hi, Rissa. Could you come over right now? I will need to ask you a favor once you’re here.
Mhm. Of course. Anything for my beloved Shiorin! I will be there in an instant.
Cool, I’m waiting for you then.
Love you, baby girl.
Okay, see ya.
*hangs up*
Oh Shiori~n. 

A suitcase with a combination lock.
This is where I keep my hacksaw. Okay, now, what was the code? I don’t remember, but think I have it written down somewhere. Maybe in my bedroom? I feel like I’m walking back and forth all over the house, but at least this will help me get my steppies done for today.
*if opened without note*
Or I could just brute force it.

Oh, I found it!
A handwritten note with the code “050_” written on it. The last digit is illegible.
Well, I can just brute force the last one.

Maybe I should stay home?
Stay home and watch Shiori’s vods.
Go anyway.

As my last wish, I would like to ask you one last time to
Give me head pats.
Step on me.
Okay.

This is my nightstand where I used to keep my gum wad.

This is where I work and watch the streams of Shiorin, Biboo, Fuwamoco, Kiwawa, Ollie… My harem is big; the list of my girlfriends is quite long.

This is my double bed, always ready for a visit from one of my girlfriends.

This is where I brush and floss my perfect teeth at least 3 times a day.

What was that? Kinda sounded like Nerissa’s big gyatt falling down the stairs.
I guess it doesn’t matter. Anyway, let’s start the ritual.

I guess he wasn’t innocent enough.

So, what am I supposed to do now?

Is that an ambulance? And it’s coming this way? This is my chance! I have to get out of this room and tell them what is happening here.

Business plan
Step 1. Find Rissa’s lost gum wad.
Step 2. Auction it off to jailbirds for a lot of money.
Step 3. Be rich.
I… I don’t know what to think about this…

An ordinary closet.
Perfect for hiding.

Fuwamoco at the end:
I don’t really understand what happened. (M)
Me too, Moco-chan. (F)

Where did he go? (FWMC M?)
You don’t have to worry about that. (S)
Oh, o-okay. (FWMC M?)
(Guess he’s dead.) (F) only fuwamoco route
(And got disposed of.) (M)  only fuwamoco route

Where did he go? (M)
You don’t have to worry about it. (S)
Oh… o-okay. (M)
Wh-What happened? I thought I died.
We patched you up. (S)
With bandages. (F)
And push-ups. (M)
And some condensed Shiorium. (S)
…push-ups?
Maybe I’m not the one to say this, but should really take better care of yourself [name]. You shouldn’t let other people cut you up and cannibalize you. (S)
Now go home darling and take a good rest. (N)
You really need it. I don’t know why the paramedics didn’t want to take you to the hospital.
And wipe the footprints off your face. You look really dumb. (S if stepped)
Been there. (N if stepped)
Umm… thanks… I guess you’re right.
*at the door*
Goodbye, everyone.
Goodbye and see you next time! (S)
*leaves*
I guess it’s Shiover for real this time. For real. For real. (S)
*happy emoticons*
I love you all. (S)
Oh, I love you too, baby girl. (N)
We love you too. (FWMC & B)
*happy emoticons*
*credits*
Good thing we managed to save that one; I don’t have another empty pot.
*menacingly cuts to pot*
